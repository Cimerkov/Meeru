                    Much of this stunning Maldives Island remains untouched with its fringing coconut palm trees and abundant vegetation. The resort makes part of the very well known Maldivian concept of “One Island - One Resort” and is located in North Male Atoll . The island is 1200 meters long by 350 meters wide and about 32 hectares (80 acres).
                    Meeru is a multiple-award winning Resort in the Maldives and is rated as the top All Inclusive Resort with family-friendly facilities, personalized service and the comforts of a second home.
